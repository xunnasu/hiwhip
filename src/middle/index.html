        <div class="aboutContent">Smartwhip is located in the city of Amsterdam. We opened our doors in 2019, with the expressed purpose of revolutionising cream chargers in the professional catering industry.
            Throughout the years we have recognised the extreme working conditions and pressure involved with working in industrial kitchens. As a young and growing company, we wanted to find a solution for this because we believe that the rise of new innovative technologies could be beneficial in resolving this matter, which is what led to the innovative Smartwhip system.
            We pride ourselves in providing high-quality products with the cost kept on a minimum. Our principle mission is to provide you with a fast-paced, efficient, cost-effective and innovative system for your cream charger operations. Smartwhip is designed to be easy to use which would allow you to make the most of your time in the kitchen, preventing any hassle, delays and unsatisfied eaters.
            More importantly, our goal is to understand you, our customers, and provide you with the best possible solutions to your difficulties in the kitchen. We believe that it is exactly through this that we can constantly improve and produce high-standard and innovative products, and become the leading brand in the cream charger industry.
